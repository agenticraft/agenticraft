# AgentiCraft Test Results - Day 5

## 🎉 Test Suite Running Successfully!

### Test Summary
- **Total Tests**: 83 collected
- **Passed**: 67 tests ✅
- **Failed**: 10 tests ❌
- **Skipped**: 6 tests ⏭️
- **Duration**: ~70 seconds

### Failed Tests
All failures are in the fabric module:
1. `test_enhanced_fabric.py` - mesh network, consensus, reasoning traces
2. `test_sdk_integration.py` - SDK preferences and adapters  
3. `test_unified.py` - MCP initialization

### Key Achievements
- ✅ Test suite no longer hanging on collection
- ✅ sys.exit() issues fixed in 9 files
- ✅ Core tests passing
- ✅ Import system stable

### Coverage
Coverage generation hanging - likely due to:
- Complex async/threading code
- Circular imports in some modules
- WebSocket/server code blocking

## Recommendations
1. Use `--cov-config` to exclude problematic modules
2. Run coverage on subsets of code
3. Fix fabric module tests in Week 2

## Week 1 Status: COMPLETE ✅
- Import system: Fixed
- Test suite: Running
- Documentation: Organized
- Ready for Week 2 refactoring!
