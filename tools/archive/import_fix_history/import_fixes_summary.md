# Test Import Fixes Summary

## Issues Found
Your tests were failing because of import errors after the refactoring. The main issues were:

1. **Auth imports**: Tests expecting `JWTAuth` and `APIKeyAuth` from `agenticraft.core.auth`
2. **Fabric imports**: Tests importing from `agenticraft.fabric.agent` expecting unified components

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Auth Module Compatibility (Fixed ✓)
**File**: `/agenticraft/core/auth/__init__.py`
- Added compatibility aliases:
  ```python
  JWTAuth = JWTAuthProvider
  APIKeyAuth = APIKeyAuthProvider
  ```
- Updated `__all__` to export these aliases

### 2. Fabric Module Exports (Fixed ✓)
**File**: `/agenticraft/fabric/__init__.py`
- Added imports from `unified.py` module
- Made unified components available at fabric level

### 3. Fabric Agent Compatibility (Fixed ✓)
**File**: `/agenticraft/fabric/agent.py`
- Added imports from `unified.py` at the end
- Made components available via `from agenticraft.fabric.agent import ...`

## Tests That Should Now Work
- `tests/workflows/test_templates.py`
- `tests/workflows/test_visualizer.py`
- `tests/fabric/test_unified.py`
- Other workflow tests importing auth components

## Potential Remaining Issues

### 1. Missing Protocol Implementations
Some tests might fail if they depend on actual protocol implementations:
- `agenticraft.protocols.mcp` (MCPClient, MCPServer)
- `agenticraft.protocols.a2a` (A2AClient, A2AServer)

### 2. Missing Adapter Module
The fabric `__init__.py` tries to import from `.adapters` which might not exist:
```python
from .adapters import (
    ProtocolAdapter,
    AdapterRegistry
)
```
I wrapped this in a try/except to prevent import errors.

### 3. Other Refactoring Conflicts
There might be other modules that were moved/renamed during refactoring that tests depend on.

## Next Steps

1. **Run tests again** to see if the import errors are resolved:
   ```bash
   pytest -xvs
   ```

2. **Check for missing modules** that tests depend on:
   ```bash
   find tests -name "*.py" -exec grep -l "from agenticraft" {} \; | xargs grep "from agenticraft" | sort | uniq
   ```

3. **Create stubs** for any missing protocol implementations if needed

4. **Update test imports** if they're pointing to old module locations

## Quick Test Command
To test just the previously failing tests:
```bash
pytest -xvs tests/workflows/test_templates.py tests/fabric/test_unified.py tests/workflows/test_visualizer.py
```
