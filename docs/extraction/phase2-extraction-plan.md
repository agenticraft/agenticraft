# AgentiCraft Phase 2: High-Value Components to Extract

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

Based on the extraction analysis, here are the highest-value components from `agentic-framework` that we should consider extracting in Phase 2 of AgentiCraft development.

## ðŸŒŸ Priority 1: Advanced RAG System (Week 1)

### Why It's Critical:
- Dramatically improves answer quality for all workflows
- State-of-the-art retrieval techniques
- Already well-implemented in source

### Components to Extract:
```python
/core/advanced_rag.py  # 2,000+ lines
- HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings)
- Multi-Query Retrieval  
- Contextual Compression
- Fusion Retrieval
- Recursive Retrieval
- Hierarchical RAG
```

### Integration Plan:
1. Extract RAG strategies as a new module: `/agenticraft/rag/`
2. Integrate with existing workflows:
   - Research Team: Use Multi-Query + Fusion
   - Customer Service: Use Contextual Compression
   - Code Review: Use Hierarchical RAG

### Expected Impact:
- 2-3x improvement in answer relevance
- Better handling of complex queries
- Reduced hallucination

## ðŸ¤– Priority 2: Domain-Specific Agent Library (Week 2)

### High-Value Agent Domains:

#### 1. Data Science Agents
```python
/core/reasoning/specialized_agents/data_science/
- DataScientist: Statistical analysis, hypothesis testing
- MLEngineer: Model building, optimization
- DataAnalyst: Data exploration, visualization
- DataEngineer: Pipeline design, ETL
```

#### 2. Healthcare Agents  
```python
/core/reasoning/specialized_agents/healthcare/
- MedicalResearcher: Literature review, study design
- ClinicalAnalyst: Patient data analysis
- HealthcareCompliance: Regulatory guidance
```

#### 3. Creative Agents
```python
/core/reasoning/specialized_agents/creative/
- ContentWriter: Blog posts, articles
- CreativeDirector: Campaign planning
- Screenwriter: Script development
- SocialMediaManager: Content strategy
```

#### 4. E-commerce Agents
```python
/core/reasoning/specialized_agents/ecommerce/
- ProductManager: Product strategy
- MarketingAnalyst: Campaign analysis
- CustomerInsights: Behavior analysis
- PricingStrategist: Dynamic pricing
```

### Integration Plan:
1. Create `/agenticraft/agents/domains/` structure
2. Extract 15-20 highest-value agents
3. Create domain-specific workflows

## ðŸ‘¥ Priority 3: Human-in-the-Loop System (Week 3)

### Critical Components:
```python
/core/human_loop/
- approval_system.py      # Human approval workflows
- feedback_collector.py   # Collect human feedback
- intervention_manager.py # Allow human intervention
- workflow_control.py     # Pause/resume/modify workflows
```

### Use Cases:
1. **Approval Gates**: Require human approval for critical decisions
2. **Quality Control**: Human review of agent outputs
3. **Learning Loop**: Incorporate feedback to improve agents
4. **Safety**: Human override for sensitive operations

### Integration Example:
```python
workflow = ResearchTeam(
    human_approval_required=True,
    approval_threshold=0.8
)

# Workflow pauses for human approval at key points
result = await workflow.research_with_approval(topic)
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Priority 4: Multimodal Capabilities (Week 4)

### Components:
```python
/core/multimodal/
- vision/          # Image understanding
- voice/           # Speech processing  
- streaming/       # Real-time processing
- embodied_ai/     # Physical world interaction
```

### Key Features:
1. **Vision**: Analyze images, diagrams, charts
2. **Voice**: Transcription, voice commands
3. **Streaming**: Real-time data processing
4. **Documents**: PDF, image extraction

### Use Cases:
- Customer Service: Handle image uploads
- Code Review: Analyze architecture diagrams
- Research: Process scientific figures

## ðŸ§  Priority 5: Meta-Reasoning System

### Components:
```python
/core/reasoning/meta_reasoning/
- self_reflection.py      # Agent self-evaluation
- strategy_selection.py   # Dynamic strategy choice
- learning_loop.py        # Continuous improvement
```

### Benefits:
- Agents that improve over time
- Automatic strategy optimization
- Self-correcting behaviors

## ðŸ“Š Extraction Effort Estimation

| Component | Files | Lines | Effort | Value | ROI |
|-----------|-------|-------|--------|-------|-----|
| Advanced RAG | 1 | 2,000 | 3 days | Critical | Very High |
| Data Science Agents | 4 | 2,000 | 2 days | High | High |
| Healthcare Agents | 3 | 1,500 | 2 days | High | High |
| Creative Agents | 4 | 2,000 | 2 days | Medium | Medium |
| Human-in-Loop | 5 | 1,500 | 4 days | Critical | Very High |
| Multimodal | 8 | 3,000 | 5 days | High | High |
| Meta-Reasoning | 3 | 1,000 | 3 days | Medium | Medium |

**Total Phase 2 Effort: ~4 weeks**
