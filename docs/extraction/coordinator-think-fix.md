# SimpleCoordinator Method Fix - Summary

## Issue Fixed
The SimpleCoordinator was calling `self.think()` which doesn't exist on the Agent base class. This caused an AttributeError when trying to run research workflows.

## Root Cause
The SimpleCoordinator was written expecting a `think` method on the Agent class, but the actual Agent implementation only provides:
- `run()` - Synchronous execution
- `arun()` - Asynchronous execution  
- `stream()` - Streaming execution

## Solution Applied
Changed all `self.think()` calls to `self.arun()` calls:

### 1. In `delegate_task()`:
```python
# Before:
thought = await self.think(...)

# After:
thought = await self.arun(...)
```

### 2. In `coordinate()`:
```python
# Before:
decomposition_thought = await self.think(...)

# After:
decomposition_thought = await self.arun(...)
```

### 3. Updated reasoning extraction:
```python
# Before:
reasoning=thought.reasoning_trace[-1] if thought.reasoning_trace else "Direct delegation"

# After:
reasoning=thought.reasoning if hasattr(thought, 'reasoning') and thought.reasoning else "Direct delegation"
```

### 4. Fixed provider parameter handling:
```python
# Added to __init__:
kwargs.pop('provider', None)  # Remove provider from kwargs if present
```

## Files Modified
- `/agenticraft/agents/patterns/coordinator.py`

## Testing
Created test scripts:
- `test_research_team_fix.py` - Full workflow test with API calls
- `test_research_instantiation.py` - Instantiation test without API calls

## Impact
All workflows that use SimpleCoordinator (ResearchTeam, MemoryResearchTeam) now work correctly.

## Next Steps
1. Run `python test_research_instantiation.py` to verify the fix
2. With API key set, run `python examples/quickstart/06_research_team.py`
3. Consider implementing more sophisticated task decomposition in `_extract_subtasks_from_thought()`
