# AgentiCraft Extraction Plan from Agentic Framework - Unified Approach

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This unified plan combines the comprehensive component inventory from the agentic-framework archive with the Hero Workflow approach. We lead with three killer workflows that showcase AgentiCraft's multi-agent capabilities, extracting only the minimal infrastructure needed to support them, while maintaining a complete reference of available components for future extraction.

**Core Strategy:** Build hero workflows first (the penthouse), extract only what makes them work (minimal foundation), keep comprehensive inventory for future expansion.

## 🚀 The Three Hero Workflows

### 1. **Research Team** (Week 1)
**The Hook:** "Build a multi-agent research team in 5 minutes"
```python
from agenticraft.workflows import ResearchTeam

team = ResearchTeam()
report = await team.research("AI frameworks market analysis")
```
**Value:** Professional research report with multi-agent coordination, transparent reasoning

### 2. **Customer Service Desk** (Week 2)
**The Hook:** "Deploy an entire customer service department with escalation"
```python
from agenticraft.workflows import CustomerServiceDesk

desk = CustomerServiceDesk()
response = await desk.handle(customer_inquiry)
```
**Value:** Complete support system with human-in-the-loop and intelligent routing

### 3. **Code Review Pipeline** (Week 3)
**The Hook:** "Automated code review with specialized agents and deployment"
```python
from agenticraft.workflows import CodeReviewPipeline

pipeline = CodeReviewPipeline()
review = await pipeline.review(github_pr)
```
**Value:** Production-ready code review with Kubernetes deployment

    def __init__(self, agents: List[Agent]):
        self.agents = agents
        self.task_queue = []
    
    async def delegate_task(self, task: str, context: dict) -> Result:
        # Extract core delegation logic
        # Add reasoning transparency
        # Remove: Complex roles, strategies, metrics
```

**Extraction Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Copy source

## 🔧 Extraction Guidelines

### For Each Component

1. **Start with Usage**
   ```python
   # First: Write how it should be used
   team = ResearchTeam()
   report = await team.research("topic")
   
   # Then: Extract only what supports this
   ```

2. **Simplify Ruthlessly**
   ```python
   # Agentic: 2000 lines of features
   # AgentiCraft: 200 lines that solve the problem
   ```

3. **Add Transparency**
   ```python
   # Every extraction must expose reasoning
   coordinator.last_delegation_reasoning
   ```

4. **Integrate Seamlessly**
   ```python
   # Use AgentiCraft patterns
   class ExtractedAgent(Agent):  # Inherit from our Agent
       async def think(self, prompt: str) -> SimpleReasoning:
           # Use our reasoning system
   ```

### Extraction Commands

```bash
# Week 1: Research Team extraction
mkdir -p agenticraft/agents/patterns
mkdir -p agenticraft/agents/specialized
