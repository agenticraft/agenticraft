# AgentiCraft Implementation Plan 2025 - Comprehensive Strategy

## 📊 Current State Assessment (Validated)

### ✅ Already Implemented (Contrary to extraction docs)
- **Security Infrastructure**: Complete sandbox system (Docker, process, restricted)
- **A2A Protocols**: Full implementation (centralized, decentralized, hybrid)
- **Authentication**: API keys, JWT, RBAC with fine-grained permissions
- **MCP Protocol**: Client/server with HTTP/WebSocket transports
- **Production Features**: Config management, Prometheus metrics, health monitoring

### 🎯 Actual Gaps to Address
1. **SDK Integration**: Need to integrate official A2A, MCP, and ANP SDKs
2. **Advanced RAG**: Missing sophisticated retrieval strategies
3. **Specialized Agents**: Only 5 basic agents vs 45+ in agentic-framework
4. **Human-in-the-Loop**: No approval/intervention system
5. **Visual Workflow Designer**: Basic implementation needs enhancement
6. **Cross-Protocol Translation**: Limited protocol interoperability
