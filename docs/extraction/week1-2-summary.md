### Hero Workflow Capabilities

| Feature | ResearchTeam | CustomerServiceDesk |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| Setup Time | < 5 minutes | < 5 minutes |
| Default Agents | 5 (2 researchers, 2 analysts, 1 writer) | 6 (3 L1, 2 L2, 1 Expert) |
| Customizable | ✅ Size, model, provider | ✅ Tiers, agents, reviewers |
| Load Balancing | ✅ | ✅ |
| Escalation | ❌ | ✅ Human reviewers |
| Authentication | ❌ | ✅ API keys |
| Production Ready | ✅ FastAPI | ✅ FastAPI + WebSocket |

## 🚀 Next Steps (Week 3)

### CodeReviewPipeline
- Complete authentication (JWT, HMAC, Bearer)
- Add Kubernetes templates
- Integrate observability
- Create code review workflow

**Target Hook:** "Automated code review with specialized agents and deployment"

```python
from agenticraft.workflows import CodeReviewPipeline

pipeline = CodeReviewPipeline()
review = await pipeline.review(github_pr)
```

## 🎯 Success Factors

### 1. **Simplicity First**
- Both workflows work with minimal configuration
- Default settings cover 80% of use cases
- Progressive disclosure of complexity

### 2. **Real-World Ready**
- Production API examples included
- Authentication and security built-in
- Monitoring and metrics available

### 3. **Transparency**
- All reasoning is accessible
- Delegation decisions are logged
- Clear escalation paths

### 4. **Extensibility**
- Easy to add agents
- Simple to customize behavior
- Clean integration points

## 💡 Key Learnings

### What's Working Well
1. **Hero workflow approach** - Clear value proposition
2. **Minimal extraction** - Only what's needed
3. **Progressive complexity** - Simple defaults, powerful options
4. **Production focus** - Real examples, not toys

### Improvements Made
1. **Simplified coordination** - Removed complex hierarchies
2. **Practical escalation** - Human-in-the-loop when needed
3. **WebSocket support** - Real-time updates for dashboards
4. **API key auth** - Simple but effective

## 📈 Impact

The two hero workflows demonstrate AgentiCraft's core value:
- **ResearchTeam**: Shows power of coordinated intelligence
- **CustomerServiceDesk**: Shows real-world application readiness

Together, they prove that multi-agent systems can be:
1. Simple to deploy
2. Powerful in practice
3. Transparent in operation
4. Ready for production

## 🎉 Ready for Week 3!

With two successful hero workflows completed, we're ready to tackle the final workflow: CodeReviewPipeline, which will showcase:
- Full authentication system
- Kubernetes deployment
- Production observability
- GitHub integration

The foundation is solid, the patterns are proven, and the path forward is clear!
