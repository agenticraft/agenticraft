# Additional Import Fixes

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Test Assertion Issue ✅
**File**: `tests/test_sdk_integration.py`
**Problem**: Mock object was not configured properly, returning `Mock.name` instead of actual string value
**Solution**: Explicitly set mock attributes instead of using constructor parameters
```python
# Before:
Mock(name="tool_execution", description="Execute tools")

# After:
mock_capability = Mock()
mock_capability.name = "tool_execution"
mock_capability.description = "Execute tools"
```

### 2. Missing UserContext ✅
**File**: `agenticraft/production/config/secure_config.py`
**Problem**: Import error - `UserContext` was missing from security module
**Solution**: Created `UserContext` dataclass in `security/abstractions/types.py`
```python
@dataclass
class UserContext:
    """Context for authenticated users."""
    user_id: str
    username: Optional[str] = None
    roles: List[str] = None
    permissions: List[str] = None
    metadata: Dict[str, Any] = None
```

## Test Status

### SDK Integration Test
```bash
pytest -xvs tests/test_sdk_integration.py
# Result: 7 tests passed ✅
```

### CLI Test
The CLI test should now import successfully since UserContext is available.

## Warnings

The warnings about `test_calculate` and `test_echo` in `tool.py` are harmless:
- They occur because pytest sees methods starting with `test_` 
- These are just example names in docstrings/comments
- They don't affect test execution

## Summary

1. ✅ Security module imports fixed
2. ✅ SDK integration test fixed 
3. ✅ UserContext added for production module
4. ⚠️ Tool.py warnings are cosmetic only

The refactoring has successfully:
- Moved authentication to `core.auth`
- Created proper separation between security and auth
- Maintained backwards compatibility where needed
